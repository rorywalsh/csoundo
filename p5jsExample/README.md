# Csound p5.js Random Example

Based on code posted to Csound mailing list by Steven Yi\<stevenyi@gmail.com\> 
and hosted [here](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-p5js)
Modified and updated by Rory Walsh.

## Description

Presents the simple Random example from the Csoundo examples as a self-contained project using p5.js and 
a WebAssembly build of Csound. 

## Local Testing

This example can be run with the latest version of Firefox without the need of a local server. Steven recommends the following options if you wish to run the examples through a local web server:

    1. If you have node.js and npm installed, install and use http-server. A useful article on setting up http-server is found here. You can install http-server with npm by running npm install -g http-server. Afterwards, go to the folder where this project is checked out and run http-server. This will start the server using the default port of 8080. Finally, go to your browser and enter the URL http://localhost:8080 and you should see this project loaded in your browser.

    2. If you have python installed, used its builtin SimpleHTTPServer by opening a terminal, going to the folder where this project is checked out and run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000. Then, go to your browser and use http://localhost:3000 as the URL to view this project.
