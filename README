What is Processing?
-------------------

"Processing is an open source programming language and environment
for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.
Initially developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach
fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context,
Processing also has evolved into a tool for generating finished
professional work. Today, tens of thousands of students, artists,
designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning,
prototyping, and production."

What is Csound?
---------------

"Csound is a sound and music synthesis system, providing facilities
for composition and performance over a wide range of platforms. It
is not restricted to any style of music, having been used for many
years in the creation of classical, pop, techno, ambient, experimental,
and (of course) computer music, as well as music for film and
television."

Building 

1) Install Csound or build from source. you will need to have a csnd6.jar to work with. It should build by default
and is also part of the pre-built Csound packages. 

2) cd to the src directory of the csoundo folder and dit the make.sh file there so that it points to 
valid core.jar and csnd6.jar files.

3) After it builds you need to copy your entire csoundo folder, minus the src directory if you wish, to your sketchbook/libraries/ folder.
This is a folder that Processing creates in your home directory when it runs.
