What is Processing?
-------------------

"Processing is an open source programming language and environment
for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.
Initially developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach
fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context,
Processing also has evolved into a tool for generating finished
professional work. Today, tens of thousands of students, artists,
designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning,
prototyping, and production."

What is Csound?
---------------

"Csound is a sound and music synthesis system, providing facilities
for composition and performance over a wide range of platforms. It
is not restricted to any style of music, having been used for many
years in the creation of classical, pop, techno, ambient, experimental,
and (of course) computer music, as well as music for film and
television."

Building 
==========================================================
1) Install Csound or build from source(Instructions below). 

2) cd to the src directory of the csoundo folder and dit the make.sh file there so that it points to 
valid core.jar and csnd6.jar files.

3) From the same directory run ./make.sh to build the library.

3) After it builds you need to copy your entire csoundo folder, minus the src directory if you wish, to your sketchbook/libraries/ folder.
This is a folder that Processing creates in your home directory when it runs.

4) Open your Processing and Processing.java files from your processing install directory and add the csound library path. Just replace the following lines:
  
  java -Djna.nosys=true processing.app.Base "$SKETCH" &

with:
  
  java -Djna.nosys=true -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib processing.app.Base "$SKETCH" &  

NOTE
------------------------
You many need to install java 1.6 in order for Processing to recognise the Csoundo library. Many flavours of Linux ship with 
Open Java. You can check the version by typing 'java -version' from the terminal. If you have openJDK installed you will need
to revert to Java SE 1.6. After you have installed Java 1.6 you will need to rebild Csound so that the csnd6.jar file is rebuilt
with the correct version of Java. 

### Notes for OSX users
If you receive an 'java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no _jcsound6 in java.library.path' error, please try dragging csoundo.jar and csnd.far from the csoundo library folder on to your csoundo example code within the Processing IDE. This will copy the libraries to a folder called 'code' contained within your sketch directory. Once this folder has been created, add a copy of lib_jcsound6.jnilib from the Csound64.framework to it. This should resolve the above error.  


Building Csound 6
==========================================================
The first thing to do is get a copy of the Csound 6 sources. The following instructions are written for those getting a copy of the source code from Git. You will need to adjust the steps accordingly when using the source tarball from the files section.

The first thing to do is make sure you have all of the required dependencies for building Csound. In a terminal, do the following:

    sudo apt-get build-dep csound
    sudo apt-get install cmake
    sudo apt-get install git

The following numbered steps are to be done in a terminal for building and installing Csound:

    cd ~
    mkdir csound
    cd csound
    git clone https://github.com/csound/csound.git csound
    mkdir cs6make
    cd cs6make
    cmake ../csound
    make -j6
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

At this point, Csound 6 should now be compiled and installed into the /usr/local set of folders.
