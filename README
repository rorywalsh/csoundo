What is Processing?
-------------------

"Processing is an open source programming language and environment
for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.
Initially developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach
fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context,
Processing also has evolved into a tool for generating finished
professional work. Today, tens of thousands of students, artists,
designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning,
prototyping, and production."

What is Csound?
---------------

"Csound is a sound and music synthesis system, providing facilities
for composition and performance over a wide range of platforms. It
is not restricted to any style of music, having been used for many
years in the creation of classical, pop, techno, ambient, experimental,
and (of course) computer music, as well as music for film and
television."

Building 
==========================================================
1) Install Csound or build from source(Instructions below). 

2) cd to the src directory of the csoundo folder and dit the make.sh file there so that it points to 
valid core.jar and csnd6.jar files.

3) From the same directory run ./make.sh to build the library.

3) After it builds you need to copy your entire csoundo folder, minus the src directory if you wish, to your sketchbook/libraries/ folder.
This is a folder that Processing creates in your home directory when it runs.

4) Open your Processing and Processing.java files from your processing install directory and add the csound library path. Just replace the following lines:
  
  java -Djna.nosys=true processing.app.Base "$SKETCH" &

with:
  
  java -Djna.nosys=true -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib processing.app.Base "$SKETCH" &  


Building Csound 6
==========================================================
The first thing to do is get a copy of the Csound 6 sources. The following instructions are written for those getting a copy of the source code from Git. You will need to adjust the steps accordingly when using the source tarball from the files section.

The first thing to do is make sure you have all of the required dependencies for building Csound. In a terminal, do the following:

    sudo apt-get build-dep csound
    sudo apt-get install cmake
    sudo apt-get install git

The following numbered steps are to be done in a terminal for building and installing Csound:

    cd ~
    mkdir csound
    cd csound
    git clone https://github.com/csound/csound.git csound
    mkdir cs6make
    cd cs6make
    cmake ../csound
    make -j6
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

At this point, Csound 6 should now be compiled and installed into the /usr/local set of folders.
